## âœ¨ Features Added

### 1. **Centered Active Skip Display**
- The selected skip (yard size) is displayed prominently in the center of the page.
- It includes an enlarged image, detailed title, price, and description.
- This draws the user's attention and provides a product-detail-like experience.

### 2. **Horizontal Scroll for All Skip Options**
- All available skip sizes are displayed in a horizontal carousel at the bottom of the page.
- Users can scroll horizontally through skip options.
- Implemented with Tailwind's utility classes (`overflow-x-auto`, `flex`, `gap-x-*`) and enhanced with a **smooth auto-scrolling effect** using `setInterval` and `scrollLeft`.

### 3. **Responsive Layout**
- Fully responsive design: looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Layout shifts gracefully using Tailwind breakpoints (`md:`, `lg:` etc.).

### 4. **Professional Styling**
- Uses a neutral color palette similar to Apple-style design (white, gray, black, minimal shadows).
- Clean spacing, padding, and border-radius for a polished, premium look.
- Hover and transition effects for better interactivity.
